#

A Spring and Hibernate based online food ordering system 🍜
- Implemented Rest APIs via Spring MVC, including registration, menu searching, ordering and checkout.
- Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data storage (menu, restaurants, etc.)
- Provided authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from malicious attacks.
- Used the Spring framework core technologies to loosely decouple all the components in the application.
- Built client-side with ReactJS and Ant Design to allow users to add items to the cart and place orders.
